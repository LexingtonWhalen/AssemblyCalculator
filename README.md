## :grey_question: What is it?
* A calculator in Assembly (MIPS).
* Only handles integers. Floats would be better, but I don't want to rewrite it!
* With that in mind, this is really just an exercise on functional MIPS.

:exclamation: Note:
* Lots of lines! Likely could thin things up. Look forward to improvement!
